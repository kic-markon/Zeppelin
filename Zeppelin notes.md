# Zeppelin notes

## Installing Zeppelin
Download the Zeppelin binary package for your environment. Things are most simple if you choose the "Package with all interpreters".
https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.3/install/install.html

Initially, start the Zeppelin server from the terminal. It will run in the background as a daemon. Later, you can find out how to do it in a more organized fashion.

Open now a browser window or tab, with the URL:
http://localhost:8080/
This should show the local Zeppelin home page, with the initial sample notebooks.

## Using the AM4 notebooks

Clone the Zeppelin repository somewhere:
```
git clone https://github.com/kic-markon/Zeppelin.git
```
This will create the local copy of the AM4 Zeppelin notebook repository, with the "notebook" directory inside.
Copy or link this into your zeppelin directory, instead of the original notebook directory.

If you restart now the Zeppelin server, the notebooks become available.
